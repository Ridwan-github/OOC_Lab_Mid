In class InventorySystem.Java:
1) The class Product should be separate which will also handle the add_product
method.
2) Too much if-else conditions: Inside the add_product class, there are too many if conditions.
3) Too big class
4) Wrong methods : The calculation methods should be under other class.
5) Order class should be separate , which will include process order method

In class globalInventoryData:
1)Calculatediscount method doesn't belongs here. It should be under another separate classes with all other calculate methods


In class reportScheduler:
1) Only one method here, so this class is unnecessary.
